# Company Data Analysis Project

Welcome to my Company Data Analysis project! This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that explores and analyzes a rich dataset with firmographics, investments, acquisitions, and employee details of various companies including tech giants like Google, IBM, and Microsoft.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to derive meaningful insights from company data spanning various aspects such as investment rounds, acquisition costs, company formation trends, and more. The analysis is structured to answer several key questions that reveal patterns and trends in the corporate world.

The dataset is divided into four main worksheets:

- **Company:** Contains firmographics of different companies.
- **Investment:** Details about investments received by companies.
- **Acquisition:** Information on acquisitions made by the companies.
- **Employee:** Employee details working in these companies.

## Questions Answered

Throughout the analysis, the project addresses multiple queries including but not limited to:

- Funding and investment patterns.
- Acquisition costs and activities.
- Historical trends in company formations and investments.
- Influence of company size on fundraising amounts.
- CEO background analysis.

A detailed list of all the questions answered is available [here](#questions-answered).
